# Question:
A crontab was set up on a load-balanced Unix server as follows:
00 0 15 * * wget -q -O /dev/null -t 1 http://172.16.0.21/api/debit-order-cron
The function being called was triggering more than once and logging multiple successful runs at the same time.

a) Explain in laymanâ€™s terms everything that the above cron job is doing?
b) Explain why you think this was being triggered more than once and how you would fix it?

## Answer:
a) The above cron job is a scheduled task on a Unix server that runs every month on the 15th day at midnight. The job uses wget to visit the specific URL. The options -q and -O /dev/null tell wget to perform the download quietly and to save the output to a null device. The -t 1 option means that wget will attempt the download only once. 


b) The cron job was being triggered more than once because if simultaneous requests are made to the same URL, the server may process them concurrently resulting in multiple successful runs being logged at the same time. To fix this issue you can add a locking mechanism to the cron job to prevent multiple instances from running simultaneously. This can be achieved by creating a lock file at the beginning of the script and checking for its existence before proceeding with the task. If the lock file exists the script should exit to prevent duplicate runs. Once the task is completed the lock file should be removed to allow the next scheduled run to proceed.
