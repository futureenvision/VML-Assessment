# Question:  
A brand-new server has been set up. When the application is tested a white screen is displayed in the browser. Describe how you would you go about diagnosing this?

# Answer:
When a white screen is displayed in the browser, it indicates that there is an issue with the application that is preventing it from rendering properly. To diagnose this issue, you can follow these steps:
- Check if any applications are open that maybe displaying a white screen. If so, close them and try again.
- Check the display connection between the screen and the server. If the connection is loose, reconnect it properly.
- Check if there are any status lights on the server that indicate an issue. If there are, consult the server's manual to identify the problem.
- Consult technical support or the server's documentation for troubleshooting steps.
