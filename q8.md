# Question:
What are the best practices to be followed while designing a secure RESTful web service

# Answer:
Some of the best practices to be followed include:

- Use HTTPS:
Ensure that all communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS to prevent interception and data theft during transmission.

- Implement authentication and authorization:
Use standard methods such as OAuth 2.0 or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for securing access to your API endpoints. Ensure proper access control mechanisms are in place based on user roles, permissions, and scopes.

- Use input validation and sanitization:
Validate all incoming requests to prevent SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS) and other vulnerabilities. Sanitize any user input to remove any potentially harmful content.

- Implement rate limiting:
Implement rate limiting on your API endpoints to protect against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and excessive resource usage.

- Use strong encryption algorithms:
Store sensitive data in an encrypted format using strong encryption algorithms such as AES256, RSA or SHA-256.

- Use tokenization:
Use tokenization for handling sensitive information instead of storing it directly in your database. This reduces the attack surface and minimizes the risk of a potential data breach.

- Keep logging and monitoring:
Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect and respond to any suspicious activity, intrusion attempts or vulnerabilities in your application.
