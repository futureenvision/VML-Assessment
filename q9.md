# Question:
What will rm -rf * do on Unix?

# Answer:
`rm -rf *` will recursively remove all files and directories in the current directory without prompting for confirmation. The `-r` option stands for "recursive" and the `-f` option stands for "force", which means that `rm` will not prompt you for confirmation before deleting the files.
