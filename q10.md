# Question:
A file exists on a Unix system which has text content of “dogs are rad”. How do you find the name of the file?

# Answer:
find . -type f -exec grep -l 'dogs are rad' {} \;

The `find` command is used to search for files in a directory hierarchy based on various criteria. In this case, we are searching for files (`-type f`) that contain the text "dogs are rad". The `-exec` option is used to execute the `grep` command on each file found by `find`. The `-l` option of `grep` is used to print the names of files with matching content. By using this command, you can find the name of the file that contains the specified text content.
