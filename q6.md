# Question:
When would you use git rebase instead of git merge?

# Answer:
I would use Git rebase when I want to integrate changes from one branch into another.
This would be useful when I want to maintain a clean, linear project history.
Git merge takes all the changes and merges them into a new commit, 
while Git rebase moves the entire feature branch to begin on the tip of the master branch,
effectively incorporating all the new changes in the master branch.

For example:
- merge when you add a new feature to your project, you create a new branch for that feature.
When you are done with the feature, you merge the feature branch back into the master branch.

- rebase when changes have been made to the master branch while you were working on your feature branch,
you can use git rebase to move your feature branch to the tip of the master branch.
