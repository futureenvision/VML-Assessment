# Question:
How would you deal with caching paginated results when the ordering/properties can be changed?

# Answer:
When caching paginated results where the ordering or properties can be changed, you need to consider the cache invalidation strategy carefully to ensure that the cached data remains consistent and up-to-date.

One approach is to use a cache key that includes the ordering or properties used for pagination. When the ordering or properties change, you can invalidate the cache by updating the cache key or removing the cached data associated with the previous key.

Selective cache invalidation can also be used to update only the affected cache entries when the ordering or properties change, rather than clearing the entire cache. This can help minimize the impact on performance and reduce unnecessary cache updates.
